# CourseraDataScienceinPythonNotes

While being a Python beginner, I will be sharing my experience/notes of taking a Coursera Python class, Data Science in Python offered by University of Michigan. Since I am currently still taking this course, I will be uploading my solution to the assignments once I complete them. 

Please noted, my answers are definitely not perfect as myself is still learning. Any advice or suggestion is welcomed! Also, one of the reasons that I decided to create this repository is to offer helps to people who are also in this learning process.


I hope by offering a solution to the assignment, people can learn better and faster. Instead of stucking in the same problem for hours and still have no clue of what to do, this repo is here to help!  I won't just be posting solutions, but also my comments and thoughts process. 


身為一個剛開始學習 Python 的編成小白，我將會在此分享我上 Coursera - Data Science in Python 課的筆記與心路歷程。由於我的課也還沒有上完，我將會分享我 Assignment 的答案當我完成他們。請記住，我的答案絕對不會是完美的，也不會是最精簡的，但我分享的目的是可以給一些同在Python的路上的朋友，一些幫助和指引。我希望藉由這個分享，可以讓大家學這堂課學的更快且更有效率。
