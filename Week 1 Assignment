Qestion 1 
Comments: I personally think this is a pretty straightforward one. The task is to use regex to find a list of names in the given string.
Approach: I used re.findall(), which will return a list of matches instead of only returning the first match like re.match(). The regex 
          that I used is r'[A-Z]+[a-z]*' because every name will start with an uppcase letter and followed by mulitple lowercase letters. 
          The plus sign (+) is used to match one or more occurances. In other words, any combination of one uppercase letter with one or more 
          lowercase letters will be returned by this regex. 

'''python
import re
def names():
    simple_string = """Amy is 5 years old, and her sister Mary is 2 years old. 
    Ruth and Peter, their parents, have 3 kids."""

    # YOUR CODE HERE
    return re.findall(r'[A-Z]+[a-z]+', simple_string)
    raise NotImplementedError()
